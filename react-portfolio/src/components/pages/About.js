      Hello, my name is Michael DiSanto and my goal to combine my finance and accounting skills with my computer science skills related fields. I hope I have to work on projects and work obessively over them!  
      </p>
      <p>In 2015, I graduated from Bloomsburg University with a Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration with concentration 
      in Finance and a minor in Spanish. During my time at Bloomsburg, I played all four years on the men's tennis team,
      and I also had the opportunity to study abroad in Spain.

      After college, my previous work employment was from teaching tennis to working various jobs in asset management.
      In my personal and professional life, I have acculumated a lot of knowledge about how the world works. Although Accounting 
      is important to learn, I think its extremely vital to learn computer programming especially for a millenial.

      With React, this webpage acts as a bio and as a portfolio. The below links are demostration of the coding skills that I have acculumated over the last six months. 
      I hope you enjoy my work and please feel free to visit my linkedin, resume, or contact me! Let's chat!
