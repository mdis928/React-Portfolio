      <h1>About Me!</h1>
      <p>
      Hello, my name is Michael DiSanto and my goal to swtich from accounting/finance to STEM related fields and become completely obsess with my work. 
      In 2015, I graduated from Bloomsburg University with a Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration with concentration 
      in Finance and a minor in Spanish. During my time at Bloomsburg, I played all four years on the men's tennis team,
      and I also had the opportunity to study abroad in Spain. 
      </p>
      After college, my previous work employment was from teaching tennis to working various jobs in asset management.
      In my personal and professional life, I have acculumated a lot of knowledge about how the world works. Although Accounting 
      is important to learn, I think its extremely vital to learn computer programming especially for a millenial. 
      <p>
      This webpage acts as a bio and as a portfolio. The below links are demostration of the coding skills that I have acculumated over the last six months. 
      I hope you enjoy my work and please feel free to visit my linkedin, resume, or contact me! Let's chat!
